## QUESTION 1

__Calculate the average career length for players who have played at least 10 games in their career. Use years as the unit of measure.__

The average career length for players who have played at least 10 games is 5.8 years.

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
# Select Games from Batting, Picthing, and Fielding
# Group by PlayerID, sum games
# having sum >= 10

q1 = '''
SELECT a.playerID, SUM(a.G_all) as "Games", p.debut_date, p.finalgame_date, CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', p.finalgame_date) AS INTEGER) -  CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', p.debut_date) AS INTEGER) AS "Career_in_years"
FROM appearances as a
JOIN people as p
  ON p.playerID = a.playerID
GROUP BY a.playerID
HAVING Games >= 10
ORDER BY Career_in_years DESC
'''

res1_pl = pl.read_database(q1, con)
avg = res1_pl.select(pl.mean("Career_in_years"))
print(res1_pl)
print(f"Average career lenght: {avg}")
```


## QUESTION 2

1. Identify the top 10 players with the longest careers (based on the number of years they played). Include their:

    - playerID
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - career_length

Here are the 10 players with the longest careers.

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
q2 = '''
SELECT a.playerID, SUM(a.G_all) as "Games", p.nameFirst, p.nameLast, CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', p.finalgame_date) AS INTEGER) -  CAST(STRFTIME('%Y', p.debut_date) AS INTEGER) AS "Career_length"
FROM appearances as a
JOIN people as p
  ON p.playerID = a.playerID
GROUP BY a.playerID
HAVING Games >= 10
ORDER BY Career_length DESC
LIMIT 10
'''

res2_pl = pl.read_database(q2, con)
print(res2_pl)
```
